Better version to use of https://github.com/obskyr/khinsider

I made a batch file that is easier to use than the previous .py for an optimal use 

  TUTORIAL

First you need to put the .cmd and the .py in the same folder.

To download OST's, just go to https://downloads.khinsider.com/ and find one you want.

For example, we gonna try persona 5.

The url we need is "https://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/persona-5" or you can delete all path to just put "persona-5".

You will put the url here after this sentence : ```Put the website url here | Entrez l'url de l'ost voulue svp :```

Then you will check on the website what are the format of the OST and you will put it after this sentence : ```Put the desired format (mp3,m4a,flac)| Entrez le format voulu (mp3,m4a,flac):```

  Then the CMD file will do the work and you just have to wait a bit. =)
